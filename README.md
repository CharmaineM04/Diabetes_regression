# Diabetes Regression Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing regression analysis on a diabetes dataset. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, and the implementation of a regression model to predict outcomes based on patient attributes.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Implementation of a regression model using Scikit-learn
- Feature scaling for optimal performance
- Evaluation of the model's predictive accuracy

## Dataset

The analysis uses the dataset `diabetes_dirty.csv`, which contains information about patients, including:
- **Age**
- **Sex**
- **BMI** (Body Mass Index)
- **Blood Pressure (BP)**

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
